## Emma(ntal) and Tom(me) choose a cake

Wedding cake is overrated. There. They said it. You buy a wedding cake, but what you get is a fancy, sparkly, Royally iced piece of art. And once you get beyond the sickly-sweet icing, all you have is a bog-standard bit of cake, of which everyone gets approximately one cubic inch. Less if they happen to get a corner piece, because that bit is predominantly icing. Tom knows about these things. He's eaten a lot of wedding cake in his time. Usually at weddings he wasn't invited to.

What is highly rated, or even grated, is cheese. Cheese is fantastic. So they decided that instead of a big lump of fancy-looking cake, they'd have a magnificent tower of cheese. Lots of different cheeses. And they'd serve it with some fruit, and crackers, and chutneys, and everyone could just sit around after the wedding eating cheese.

So they went up to https://www.thecheeseplate.co.uk/[The Cheese Plate] in Buntingford one evening and tried a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and some of those, and maybe that one, and possibly a bit of the one over there for good luck. And it was amazing! They had a little bit of a lot of cheeses, and after much deliberation, and some more cheese, they decided on what they wanted.

Hope at The Cheese Plate helped them put together a tower with a wide range of cheeses, which looked great and had something for everyone. And, even better, the leftovers survived two weeks in their fridge and didn't stink the house out!

Cheese towers, much like marriages, need a good, firm base, so they started off with a https://www.winterdale.co.uk[Winterdale Shaw], a carbon-neutral cave-matured hard cheese from Kent.

Next up was a https://cropwellbishopstilton.co.uk/our-range/blue-shropshire/[Bassingfield Blue], an award-winning Blue Shropshire-style cheese, made in Nottinghamshire. This cheese is also firm, with a rich orange colour, and with strong blue veins running through it.

Climbing higher finds the striking https://www.lynherdairies.co.uk/cornish-yarg-lynher/[Cornish Yarg], a wonderful nettle-wrapped semi-hard cheese. Nettles are vegetables, right? Like spinach? So this cheese is probably one of your five-a-day.

Up next, with a nod to their Irish heritage, is the http://www.cashelblue.com/blue-cheese/crozier-blue-sheeps-milk-cheese/[Crozier Blue]. It might be a long way to Tipperary, but the sweetest girl Tom knows is right here!

Sat above this one was the http://www.fieldingcottage.co.uk/products-page/goats-cheese/norfolk-mardler-portions/[Norfolk Mardler], the only goat representative. Mardle, in the Norfolkian dialect, means to gossip. This cheese, from its high vantage point, could probably tell a story or two from the evening. If they hadn't eaten it first.

Getting softer, now, and we reach the https://www.villagemaidcheese.co.uk/product/maida-vale/[Maida Vale]. This cheese is made from milk from Guernsey cows, and was ale-washed to help it mature.

The penultimate cheese, a http://hampshirecheeses.co.uk/our-cheeses/[Tunworth soft cheese], was the emotional one. A British take on the French Camembert, it abandoned its stiff upper lip, melted under the pressure (and heaters), and (much like the groom) cried sweet cheesy tears all afternoon.

And finally, perched atop the tower, on the oozing, cushiony Tunworth, was the wedding classic - a heart-shaped https://www.godminster.com/explore/introduction-godminster[Godminster].

To finish off, for the kids (and the Bride), they had a couple of Bride and Groom Connie and Colin Caterpillar cakes.

## Run Away!

The Tunworth began its early escape while everyone was distracted.

As it continued its ooze down the tower, it also attempted a kidnapping of the Bride. This probably explains the groom's slightly nervous expression. He knew something was up, but wasn't sure what...

Later on, the Groom was framed for having pushed the Bride to her cheesy, sticky doom.

The Tunworth, however, continued to run. And run, and run, and run!
