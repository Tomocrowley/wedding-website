## Emma(ntal) and Tom(me) choose a cake

Wedding cake is overrated. There. We said it. You buy a wedding cake and you get a piece of art. You're paying for some fancy, sparkly, Royally iced piece of art. Once you get beyond the sickly-sweet icing, you have a bog-standard bit of cake, of which everyone gets approximately two cubic inches. Less if they happen to get a corner piece, because that bit is predominantly icing. Tom has eaten a lot of wedding cake in his time. Usually at weddings he wasn't invited to.

Wedding cake just isn't that great.

No. What is highly rated, or even grated, is cheese. Cheese is fantastic. So we decided that instead of a big lump of fancy-looking cake, we'd have a magnificent tower of cheese. Lots of different cheeses. And we'd serve it with some fruit, and crackers, and chutneys, and we'd all just sit around eating cheese.

So we went up to https://www.thecheeseplate.co.uk/[The Cheese Plate] in Buntingford one evening and tried a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and those, and maybe that one, and a bit of the one over there for good luck. And it was amazing! We had a little bit of a lot of cheeses, and after much deliberation and some more cheese, we decided on what we wanted.

Hope at The Cheese Plate helped us put together a tower with a wide range of cheeses. It looked fantastic, and, luckily for us, most of the leftovers survived in our fridge while we were away and didn't stink the house out!

Cheese towers, much like marriages, need a good, firm base, so we started off with a https://www.winterdale.co.uk[Winterdale Shaw], a carbon-neutral cave-matured hard cheese from Kent.

Next up we had a https://cropwellbishopstilton.co.uk/our-range/blue-shropshire/[Bassingfield Blue], an award-winning Blue Shropshire-style cheese, made in Nottinghamshire. This cheese is similarly firm, rich orange, and has strong blue veins running through it.

Climbing higher finds the striking https://www.lynherdairies.co.uk/cornish-yarg-lynher/[Cornish Yarg], a wonderful nettle-wrapped semi-hard cheese.

Up next, mirroring the Irish blood running through our veins, but probably slightly more royal, is the http://www.cashelblue.com/blue-cheese/crozier-blue-sheeps-milk-cheese/[Crozier Blue]. It might be a long way to Tipperary, but we're glad this cheese made the Croz-ing!

Sat above this one was the http://www.fieldingcottage.co.uk/products-page/goats-cheese/norfolk-mardler-portions/[Norfolk Mardler], our only goat representative. This cheese, which draws its name from the word 'mardle' (to gossip, in the Norfolk dialect), from its high vantage point, could probably tell a story or two from the evening. If we hadn't eaten it.

Getting softer, now, and we reach the https://www.villagemaidcheese.co.uk/product/maida-vale/[Maida Vale]. This cheese is made from milk from Guernsey cows, and ale-washed to help it mature.

The penultimate cheese, a http://hampshirecheeses.co.uk/our-cheeses/[Tunworth soft cheese], was the emotional one. A British take on the French Camembert, it abandoned its stiff upper lip, melted under the pressure (and heaters), and (much like the groom) cried sweet cheesy tears all afternoon.

And finally, perched atop the tower, on the oozing, cushiony Tunworth, was the wedding classic - a heart-shaped https://www.godminster.com/explore/introduction-godminster[Godminster].

To finish off, for the kids (and the Bride), we had a couple of Bride and Groom Connie and Colin Caterpillar cakes.

## Run Away!

The Tunworth began its early escape while everyone was distracted.

As it continued its ooze down the tower, it also attempted a kidnapping of the Bride. This probably explains my slightly nervous expression. I knew something was up, but wasn't sure what...

Later on, the Groom was framed for having pushed the Bride to her cheesy, sticky doom.

The Tunworth, however, continued to run. And run, and run, and run!
