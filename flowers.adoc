## A Beautiful Arrangement

Lizzie at https://elizabethjaneflowers.com/[Flowers by: Elizabeth Jane] was one of the first people Tom spoke to in Cambridge after starting his new job at UL EHS Sustainability. Slightly over a year later, she became one of the last people he spoke to in Cambridge after being made redundant from his new job at UL EHS Sustainability.

She runs a small pop-up flower stall at Cambridge station every Friday, and every couple of weeks Tom used to stop there to pick up a bunch of flowers for Emma. The flowers were always beautiful and (except for the time we discovered Emma was allergic to lilies) generally lasted for a good couple of weeks.

So when it came to picking a flower supplier for the wedding, Lizzie was an absolute no-brainer.

Hidden within the bridal bouquet was Emma's 'something old': a locket containing photos of both of her grandmothers.

Apparently with the sun in their eyes!
