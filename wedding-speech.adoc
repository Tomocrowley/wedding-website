= Groom's Speech

According to the wedding magazine 'Hitched', the groom has to make everyone laugh within the first three lines of his speech.

I just want to point out that I don't normally read Hitched, but I was trying to pick up a few tips for my speech, so I gave it a quick browse.

Oh. Sadly Hitched doesn't give you any tips on what to do if you waste the first 2.5 lines of your speech, and since I don't have any one-liners up my sleeve, unless I can get a sympathy chuckle from each one of you, I might as well sit back down.

No? Not even on my wedding day, huh? Well, the joke's on you, because, also according to Hitched, I have to be up here for ten minutes, so if we take off the two minutes it allows for laughter, because apparently I'm not as funny as I think I am, and the minute I've already wasted, you've got another seven minutes of this to sit through.

I hope you brought a book or something.

I'd like to thank you all for being here to celebrate this day with both of us, and for being such a big part of our lives. I imagine that some of you are probably surprised to see me standing here, and never really expected me to convince anyone to marry me. Well, me too!

I was never really much good at dating. Well, I say I wasn't, I wouldn't really know. I never really tried, to be honest. I guess I always knew that if I ever got married, it would be to someone I already knew, and had already built a relationship with. Ultimately, I guess, I always wanted to marry my best friend.

Now, if you look around the room, you will see most of my best friends from different stages of my life, and you might spot a flaw in my plan. You'll notice that almost all of them have brought their partners. You'll also notice that all of them are men. So you can see how that was working out for me!

Luckily, although I didn't know it at the time, I ended up studying psychology at the University of Hertfordshire alongside the beautiful woman you see sitting next to me. Our eyes met across an empty room, and immediately rolled in exasperation as one of the University administrators completely failed to enrol us on the course.

From that moment on, we bonded over a mutual love of psychology, and a shared hatred of everything else about Herts. And then eventually, our course finished, somehow we both graduated, and we went our separate ways. We stayed loosely in touch as I bounced around the country, but in time, we grew tighter and tighter, until one day we realised that there was an elephant-sized cupid in the room that we needed to address.

And so, we decided to make it official. On the condition that I was accepted by her dog, Oscar. A quick belly-rub later, and she agreed to introduce me to the dog. No, just kidding. But Oscar seemed to like me, and as a bonus must have put a good bark in for me with the rest of the family, too, because thus far they appear to like me.

Which brings me nicely to the subject of my new family. Right from the beginning Martin and Sharon welcomed me into the bosom of the family, although I suspect this was so that they could keep an eye on me. Over the past couple of years they have helped us enormously, and I couldn't ask for a better set of in-laws, so I'd like to thank them, and Granddad Roy, from the bottom of my heart.

Now, Martin and Sharon have had the easy ride here. They've only had to put up with me for a few years. The real long-suffering MVPs in the room have had to deal with me for a good 30-something years. So I'd like to thanks my own Mum and Dad for all the help I've received from them over the years. I wouldn't be where I am today without their support and guidance, and I love them dearly.

Luckily for me, Emma loves them almost as much as I do. I am reassured by this knowledge every time I look in the mirror or catch myself saying certain things in certain ways and realise that, little by little and day by day I'm gradually turning into my father. So even though I think my own family in turn loves Emma more than they do me, I'd like to thank my Mum and Dad for everything they've done for me and us.

It would be remiss of me to pass by without thanking all of our other friends and family members who are here today. There are of course some missing faces, some of these we just didn't invite, but others cannot be with us for various reasons, and we're sending our love out to those, too.

We're both grateful for the way we've been accepted into each other's circles of friends and family. A special mention must be made to my best men and former partners in crime, Jake and Andy. Anything they have said or might yet say is probably true, and I can only apologise for it!

And where would we be without Laura, Emma's wonderful Maid of Honour. She is definitely the sister I never knew I wanted. Or possibly the sister I knew I never wanted. I forget which! So, thank you, all of you, for your support.

Now. Anyone who's met Emma doesn't need me to tell them how great she is, but if I don't, I'll be sleeping on the sofa for the next 40 years, so...

Emma is, quite simply, my best friend. We have a lot in common - we share many values, a similar work ethic, a slightly warped sense of humour, and on top of that, she's smart, caring, and beautiful, inside and out. In short, she's the person I try to be when I wake up each morning, but by the time I get home each night, she's moved the goalposts even further.

There is no one else with whom I would rather grow old and raise a family. She makes me a better person. For example, you might notice that I'm still fully dressed and wearing shoes. You can thank Emma for that.

I could spend the next hour listing her qualities, but Hitched only gave me eight minutes, or 1,320 words, whichever comes soonest, so I will just choose my favourite one.

My favourite thing about Emma is her smile. Firstly, because it is a very pretty smile, but secondly, and possibly even more importantly, because when she smiles, it usually means I'm doing something right.

So, here's to Emma. My amazing bride and best friend. May I forever stay worthy of her smile.
