= A Love Song

## I'm a lucky man

Where do I begin to tell the story of how great a love can be?

Songs tend to be a good place to start, so it was important that the wedding music was just right.

The happy couple have a fairly small overlap when it comes to tastes in music, and once you remove all the Disney songs it gets even smaller. They also had very strong ideas on what they wanted their wedding DJ to be and, more importantly, to not be!

After researching the local music merchants, they made a fairly quick and easy decision to go with Jason from https://exclusivediscos.co.uk/[Exclusive Discos].

They didn't want an MC who needed to be the star of the show, interrupting every song with inane chatter and naff jokes. Neither did they want someone who played the same setlist at every wedding. And if a song had it's own dance (looking at you, Macarena, Cha Cha Slide, and Baby Shark), it was blacklisted.

It had to be personal and it had to be professional, because they just wanted everyone to enjoy themselves and dance to good music all night.

So Jason talked through their guest demographics with them, made some suggestions, took some suggestions, and when he'd got a few ideas he went away and compiled a collection of songs that kept the dancefloor full all night long.

## The entrance

She smiled, and then the spell was cast.

Emma, looking even more beautiful than usual, floated down the aisle to Etta James - At Last.

## The first dance

You look so wonderful in that dress.

The first dance was to Ed Sheeran's Tenerife Sea. Ed is a favourite of Emma's, and is the only artist they have been to see together (and at the Stade de France, no less). It was only fitting, then, that he soundtracked their first dance as a married couple.

## The second dance

You light up the stars and the sun.

The second dance, because sometimes Tom just has to be really awkward, was to Hybrid's Light Up. Breakbeat drum and bass isn't traditionally the next thing played after the first dance, and a 'second dance' isn't really a thing, but this song always makes Tom think of Emma, and he promised not to request anything else if it got played.

## The final three

By the end of the night, when everyone was just a tired, sweaty mess, we needed three strong songs to dance our way out to.

The Caesars - Jerk It Out
